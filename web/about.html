    <p>The Nissan <b>GT-R</b> is a high-performance sports car and grand tourer produced by Nissan that was unveiled in 2007.It is the successor to the <b>Skyline GT-R</b>, although no longer part of the Skyline range itself, that name now being used for Nissan's luxury-sport market.
	<br><br>The <b>GT-R</b> is an entirely new model sharing little with the <b>Skyline GT-R</b> save its signature four round tail lights. Like some later generations of the <b>Skyline GT-R</b>, the <b>GT-R</b> has all-wheel drive with a twin-turbocharged 6-cylinder engine. But the four-wheel-steering HICAS system has been removed and the former straight-6 RB26DETT engine has been replaced with a new VR38DETT V6 engine. Because of the GT-R's heritage, the chassis code for the all-new version has been called CBA-R35, or R35 for short (where CBA stands for the emissions standard prefix), carrying on the naming trend from previous <b>Skyline GT-R</b> generations.
	<br><br>The <b>GT-R</b> has also retained its Skyline predecessor's nickname, <b>Godzilla</b>,originally given to it by the Australian motoring publication Wheels in its July 1989 edition.
