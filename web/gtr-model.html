				<p>After discontinuing the Skyline GT-R in 1973, Nissan revived the GT-R nameplate again in 1989. At the time Nissan was competing in Group A Racing with the Skyline GTS-R. Nissan wanted to retire the GTS-R in favor of a more competitive vehicle. The new generation of the GT-R, E-BNR32 chassis (commonly shortened to R32), was designed to dominate Group A class racing<a href="gtr32.html"> ...Read More...</a></p>

				<p>The E-BCNR33 (R33) was developed even as the non GT-R R33 models went on sale in August 1993 (with a prototype being shown at the 1993 Tokyo Motor Show) for release in 1995 as a successor to the R32 model. The engine in the R33 was nearly identical to the R32. It used the same turbochargers and the same specification for the manual gearbox, although the syncros were stronger.<a href="gtr33.html"> ...Read More...</a></p>

				<p>The GF-BNR34 (R34) Skyline GT-R, GT-R V·Spec and GT-R V·Spec N1 models were introduced in January 1999. The R34 GT-R was shorter (from front to rear), and the front overhang was reduced as compared to its predecessor. The valve covers were painted glossy red (colour code Cherry Red Effect Z24 or X1020)[citation needed], as opposed to black in previous models.<a href="gtr34.html"> ...Read More...</a></p>

				<p>The production version of the GT-R debuted at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show as the 2009 model year, with a lap time of 7:38 minutes at the Nürburgring Nordschleife beating the all-time sports classic Porsche 911 Turbo as Nissan stated before launching the car. The GT-R launched in the Japanese market on December 6, 2007. The U.S. official launch was seven months later on July 7, 2008. Universal Nissan in Los Angeles provided a customer with the delivery of a new GT-R, fresh from the production line at 12:01 am, on July 7, 2008. The Canadian launch was also in July 2008. Europe became the third consumer market, where it launched in March 2009. The large disparity in initial marketing between these regional releases is due to Nissan having to build GT-R performance centers where the car is serviced.<a href="gtr35.html"> ...Read More...</a></p>

				<p>The Nissan GT-R50 by Italdesign starts with our latest GT-R NISMO and reinterprets it with a European-style sensibility, combining Japanese performance and Italian craftsmanship. After a strong global tour with the GT-R50 prototype making appearances at Goodwood, Spa-Francorchamps, Nissan Crossing and more, a customer version inspired by the prototype will be produced, with each car tailored for each customer. Italdesign will build no more than 50 vehicles.<a href="gtr50.html"> ...Read More...</a></p>
