				<h3>Nissan GTR R-33</h3>
				<h4>About</h4>
				<p>The E-BCNR33 (R33) was developed even as the non GT-R R33 models went on sale in August 1993 (<i>with a prototype being shown at the 1993 Tokyo Motor Show</i>) for release in 1995 as a successor to the R32 model. The engine in the R33 was nearly identical to the R32. It <b>used the same turbochargers and the same specification for the manual gearbox</b>, although the syncros were stronger. The engine corrected the R32's weak oil pump drive collar, which tended to fail in higher power applications, by using a wider collar (<i>also fixed in spec 2 R32's prior to R33 release</i>). The base model of the <b>R33 GT-R weighs 1.540 kg</b> (3.395 lb).</p>
				<br>
				<p>The R33 GT-R went on sale on <b>6 January 1995</b> with the base model GT-R and the V Spec model. The V Spec model weighed in 10 kg heavier, and had sportier suspension resulting in lower ground clearance. The V Spec also featured the newer <b>ATTESA E-TS Pro all wheel drive system</b>, which included an Active Limited Slip differential. At the same time as the introduction of the R33 GT-R and GT-R V Spec, Nissan introduced the <b>R33 GT-R V Spec N1 model</b>. Changes made to the R33 N1 are similar to those in the R32 N1. The car was made lighter by removing the ABS, air conditioning, sound system, rear wiper, and boot carpet. The R33 GT-R V·Spec N1 received the slightly revised R33 N1 engine</p>
				<br>
				<p>The <b>R33 ended production on 9 November 1998.</b> The last R33 GT-R produced was a V-Spec in GV1 <b>finished in Black Pearl colour</b>.In 1995, Best Motoring conducted a test of the GT-R R33 at the Nürburgring Nordscheleife. Driven by Motoharu Kurosawa, <b>the car did a 8:01.72 minutes lap time around the track.</b> At the time, it was the fastest road-legal series production car and second fastest road-legal production car around the track. In 1996, the record was broken by Dirk Schoysman in a GT-R R33 V-Spec for Best Motoring with a lap time of 7:59 minutes. <b>In 1999, the record was broken by a GT-R R34</b>.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Nissan mostly competed in Group C racing with purpose built prototype race cars after the R32 GT-R was ousted from the Group A racing but rule changes for Group C forced Nissan to abandon Group C racing. Nissan then set out to develop one of its existing cars to enter the GT1 class racing in the BPR racing series. The company decided to base the new GT1 car on the R33 LM race car. The weight of the car was reduced to 1.150 kg and the all-wheel-drive system was removed. The car was also considerably widened and lowered with a new bodykit in order to increase downforce. The car was equipped with the N1 specification engine which had a power output of 298 kW (<i>405 PS; 400 hp</i>). <b>The engine was mated to a 6-speed sequential manual transmission manufactured by Xtrac</b>.</p>
		
				<br><p>The homologation rules for GT1 class in 1995 required one road going equivalent to be made. Thus a single road going LM car was developed and stored at Nissan's Zuma facility. The road version of the car was detuned to 224 kW (<i>305 PS; 300 hp</i>) and was equipped by the same 50 mm wider bodykit as the racing version. The interior remained the same as the standard R33 GT-R albeit with an Alcantara rimmed steering wheel and racing bucket seats. Two race cars were built having numbers 22 and 23. They were entered in the 1995 season of LeMans but faced tough competition from more powerful race cars such as the Ferrari F40 LM and the McLaren F1 GTR. The number 22 car driven by H. Fukuyama and S. Kasuya qualified in the 34th season and finished<b> 5th in its class with an overall position of 10th </b>while the number 23 retired after 157 laps due to gearbox damage. Due to the entry of purpose built race cars by using loopholes in the regulations such as the Porsche 911 GT1, Nissan decided to withdraw for the 1996 season.</p>
