				<h3>Nissan GT-R R50</h3>
				<h4>Overview</h4>
				<p>The <b>Nissan GT-R50</b> by Italdesign starts with our latest GT-R NISMO and reinterprets it with a <b>European-style sensibility, combining Japanese performance and Italian craftsmanship</b>. After a strong global tour with the GT-R50 prototype making appearances at Goodwood, Spa-Francorchamps, Nissan Crossing and more, a customer version inspired by the prototype will be produced, with each car tailored for each customer. Italdesign will build <b>no more than 50 vehicles</b>.</p>
				
				<h4>ITALDESIGN</h4>
				<p>One of the world’s leading companies in the provision of development services for the automotive industry. The mission of Italdesign is to provide a wide range of services dedicated to the development of new vehicles and industrial products, <i>ranging from styling to engineering and from prototypes manufacturing to testing and validation</i>.</p>
				
				<h4>Design</h4>
				<p>While Italdesign developed, engineered and constructed the car, the distinctive, crisp exterior and interior designs originated from Nissan’s design centers in London and San Diego. Key design features include a pronounced power bulge on the hood, stretched LED headlights, lowered roofline and prominent “samurai blade” cooling outlets behind the front wheels. A large, adjustable rear wing, mounted with two uprights, completes the overall look. The exterior is finished in a <i>“Liquid Kinetic Gray”</i> with distinctive, <i>Energetic Sigma Gold</i> accents.</p>
				
				<p>Reflecting its modern high performance pedigree, the interior to the <b>GT-R50</b> features extensive use of two different carbon fiber finishes across the center console, instrument panel and door linings, along with black Alcantara and fine black Italian leather on the seats. Gold accents echo the exterior treatment throughout the cockpit.<b> The GT-R50 steering wheel is bespoke, made of carbon fiber and trimmed with Alcantara.</b></p>
				<br><p>Nissan developed a 6-stage paint process with a double clear coat and chip-resistant paint for use in critical areas of the GT-R chassis. An optional liquid-effect finish employs a hand-polished 8-stage process with product-specific Super Silver metallic paint and three layers of clearcoat.</p>
				<h4>Specifications</h4>
				<p>Drawing on Nissan’s extensive GT3 racing experience, the NISMO organization enhanced the hand-assembled <b>3.8-liter V6 VR38DETT</b> engine to produce an estimated <b>720PS and 780Nm of torque.</b> A revised suspension via Bilstein and upgraded Brembo braking system help handle the extra power.</p>
