				<h3>Nissan GT-R R35</h3>
				<h4>Production model</h4>
				<p>The production version of the GT-R debuted at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show as the 2009 model year,<b> with a lap time of 7:38 minutes</b>  at the Nürburgring Nordschleife <b> beating the all-time sports classic Porsche 911 Turbo </b> as Nissan stated before launching the car. The GT-R launched in the Japanese market on <b>December 6, 2007</b> . The U.S. official launch was <b> seven months later on July 7, 2008.</b>  Universal Nissan in Los Angeles provided a customer with the delivery of a new GT-R, fresh from the production line, on July 7, 2008. The Canadian launch was also in July 2008. Europe became the third consumer market, where it launched in<b> March 2009</b> . The large disparity in initial marketing between these regional releases is due to Nissan having to build GT-R performance centers where the car is serviced. The engines are hand built by only four specially trained mechanics called <b> "Takumi Craftsmens"</b>  on a special line at Nissan's Yokohama plant and their names are badged on every GT-R engine. The cars are built at their Tochigi plant on a shared production line.</p>
				<br>
				<h4>Design</h4>
				<p>Nissan chief creative officer, <b> Shirō Nakamura</b> , has likened the new GT-R to the giant robots of the Gundam series. Nakamura stated: <b>    <i> "The GT-R is unique because it is not simply a copy of a European-designed Sports car</i> </b> ; it had to really reflect Japanese culture."Nissan's American designers sculpted the rear three-quarters of the vehicle, while their European designers sculpted the roofline. Polyphony Digital, creators of the <b> Gran Turismo series of motor racing video games, were themselves involved in the development of the GT-R,</b>  having been contracted to design the GT-R's multifunction display</p>
				<br>
				<p>As of 2014 the GT-R was the only model built on Nissan's Premium Midship (PM) platform, an evolution of the Front Midship (FM) architecture introduced on the 2001 (V35) Skyline. It is a hybrid unibody assembled on ultra-low-tolerance jigs similar to those used in race car construction. Alcoa aluminum is used for the hood, trunk lid, and outer door skins, with die-cast aluminum front shock towers and inner door structures. Outer body panels are stamped using a multiple-strike coining process for added rigidity and precision. The chassis is stiffened with a carbon-composite front cross member/radiator support.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Nissan developed a <b> 6-stage paint process with a double clear coat and chip-resistant paint</b>  for use in critical areas of the GT-R chassis. An optional liquid-effect finish employs a hand-polished 8-stage process with product-specific Super Silver metallic paint and three layers of clearcoat.</p>
		
				<br><p>
				<h4>Specifications</h4>
				<b> The Nissan GT-R</b>  is powered by the VR38DETT <b> V6 engine</b> , a 3.799 cc (<i> 3,8 L</i> ) DOHC V6 with plasma transferred wire arc sprayed cylinder bores. Two parallel Ishikawajima-Harima (IHI) turbochargers provide forced induction. Models manufactured between 2007 and 2009 are rated at a manufacturer-claimed engine output of 358 kW (<i> 487 PS; 480 hp</i> ) at 6.400 rpm and 583 Nm (<i> 430 lb ft</i> ) at <b> 3.200–5.200 rpm</b> . The engine also meets California Air Resources Board Ultra Low Emission Vehicle (ULEV) standards. The standard GT-R and the <b> NISMO GT-R</b>  has a drag coefficient of <i> Cd=0.27</i> .</p>
				
				<br><p>A curb weight of <b> 1.724 kg</b>  (<i> 3.800 lb</i> ) with side curtain airbags is achieved using a jig welded steel chassis with aluminium used for the hood, trunk, and doors. A rear mounted six-speed BorgWarner designed dual-clutch automatic transmission built by <b> Aichi Machine Industry</b> shifting gears in just <b> 0.2 seconds</b>  is used in conjunction with the ATTESA E-TS system[28] to provide power to <b> all four wheels</b> , along with Nissan's Vehicle Dynamics Control (VDC-R) to aid in stability. Three shift modes can also be selected for various conditions. The Nissan GT-R features four-wheel , floating disc Brembo brakes with monoblock calipers (<i> six-piston on the front; four-piston on the rear</i>)</p>
