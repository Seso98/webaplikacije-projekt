				<h3>GTR R-32</h3>
				<h4>Concept</h4>
				<p>After discontinuing the Skyline GT-R in 1973, Nissan revived the GT-R nameplate again in 1989. At the time Nissan was competing in Group A Racing with the Skyline GTS-R. Nissan wanted to retire the GTS-R in favor of a more competitive vehicle. The new generation of the GT-R, E-BNR32 chassis (<i>commonly shortened to R32</i>), was designed to dominate Group A class racing.</p>
				<br>
				<p><b>Nissan Kohki</b> (<i>Nissan's power train engineering and manufacturing facility</i>) originally tested a twin turbocharged 2,4 L (2.350 cc) bored and stroked version of the RB20 engine. This set up resulted in a power output of 233 kW <b>(317 PS; 312 hp)</b> and used a rear wheel drive drivetrain. Under Group A regulations, a turbocharged engine must multiply its engine displacement by 1.7, putting the new Skyline in the 4.000 cc class, and requiring the use of 10-inch-wide tyres. Knowing that they would be required to use 10-inch-wide tyres, Nissan decided to make the car all wheel drive. Nissan developed a special motorsport-oriented AWD system for this purpose called the ATTESA E-TS. Although this assisted with traction, it made the car 100 kg heavier; the added weight put the GT-R at a disadvantage to other cars in the 4.000 cc class. Nissan then made the decision to increase the displacement to 2.600 cc, and put the car in the 4.500 cc class, with the car's weight near-equal to competing cars. The 4.500 cc class also allowed for 11-inch-wide tyres. New engine block and heads were then developed to better match the increased displacement. The result was a car that had a power output of 447 kW (<i>608 PS; 599 hp</i>).Later REINIK (Racing & Rally Engineering Division Incorporated Nissan Kohi) produced Group A racing engines rated between 373–485 kW (<i>507–659 PS; 500–650 hp</i>) depending on track conditions.</p>
				<br>
				<h4>Production</h4>
				<p>This new 2.568 cc (2,6 L) RB26DETT-powered all wheel drive concept was put into production as the <b>R32 Nissan Skyline GT-R</b>. The <b>R32 </b>developed 206 kW (<i>280 PS; 276 hp</i>) at 6.800 rpm and 260 lb ft (353 Nm) of torque at 4.400 rpm,it had a curb weight of 1.430 kg (3.150 lb). Nissan officially started its production run <b>21 August 1989</b>, and began its Group A campaign in 1990.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The <b>Skyline GT-R Nismo</b>, identified by the model code suffix "RA", was introduced on 22 February 1990 and attracted a lot of people. It existed to homologate a number of changes related to performance, aerodynamics, weight-saving and reliability for Group A racing. Those rules required a production run of 500 units, under the "Evolution" special regulations, but an additional 60 were produced and held by Nissan to turn into race cars, rising the production total to 560 units. Aerodynamic changes include: two additional ducts in the front bumper and removal of the protective honeycomb mesh to improve airflow to the intercooler, a bonnet lip spoiler to direct more air into the engine bay, deeper rear spats, and an additional boot lip spoiler to provide more downforce. The Nismo specification deletes ABS, which is not legal in Group A, and the rear wiper to save weight. The bonnet and front panels are aluminium in all GT-R models rather than the standard steel in non GT-R models, again to save weight. Overall the GT-R Nismo weighs 1.400 kg (3.086 lb) compared to 1.430 kg (3.153 lb) for the standard <b>GT-R</b>. Tyres are Bridgestone RE71 in 225/55R16 fitted to 16-inch alloy wheels. Mechanically, the GT-R Nismo uses the RB26 engine of the 'standard' GT-R but replaces the standard Garrett T03 turbo chargers with larger T04B models, sacrificing the faster spool up of the ceramic turbo wheels for the enhanced reliability of steel wheels. The <b>GT-R Nismo was only available in colour code KH2 "Gun Grey Metallic"</b>. Other minor, but noticeable, changes include a circular "Nismo" logo on the right-rear of the boot lip, lack of radio tuning controls on the dashboard console (since a radio was optional), and cross-drilled brake rotors. Nismo-branded options available included a <b>260 km/h </b>(162 mph) speedometer, 3-inch cat-back exhaust system, front suspension tower brace, sports shock absorbers, 17-inch alloy wheels, and a rear spoiler with a built-in third brake light.</p>
		
				<br><p><b>The Skyline GT-R 'N1' model</b> (<i>identified by the model code suffix "ZN"</i>), was introduced on 19 July 1991, and designed for home-market N1 racing with a total of 245 units eventually produced (<i>118 of these are 'N1', 64 are 'V·Spec N1', and 63 are 'V·Spec II N1' - see below explanation of 'V.spec'</i>). The most notable change was in the engine, which was upgraded to the R32-N1 specification. Building on the 'Nismo' car's specification, it was also lightened by the removal of the ABS, and rear wiper, but for 'N1' the air conditioning, sound system, and boot carpet were also deleted, and distinctive light-weight headlights were fitted. 'N1' cars also had reinforcing for the brake master cylinder and additional brake cooling ducts under the car. All <b>'N1' cars were delivered with a thin layer of colour code 326 "Crystal White" paint</b>.</p>
