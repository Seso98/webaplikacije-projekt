				<h3>Nissan GTR R-34</h3>
				<h4>About</h4>
				<p>The GF-BNR34 (R34) Skyline GT-R, GT-R V-Spec and GT-R V-Spec N1 models were introduced <b>in January 1999</b>. The <b>R34 GT-R</b> was shorter (from front to rear), and the front overhang was reduced as compared to its predecessor. The valve covers were painted glossy red (colour code Cherry Red Effect Z24 or X1020)as opposed to black in previous models</p>
				<br>
				<p>A new feature on the R34 GT-R is a 5.8" <b>LCD multifunction display on the center of the dashboard</b>, which shows seven different live readings of engine and vehicle statistics such as turbocharger pressure (1.2 bar max), oil and water temperature, among others. The GT-R V-Spec model added two extra features to the display: intake and exhaust gas temperatures. Nismo Multi-function Displays (MFD) could be bought at an extra cost, they included a lap timer, G-Force meter and an increase in boost pressure measurement to 2 bar. The R34 GT-R was made shorter in response to customer concerns who thought the R33 was too bulky</p>
				<br>
				<p>Like the R33, the new R34 GT-R V-Spec (<i>Victory Specification</i>) models come equipped with the ATTESA E-TS Pro system and an Active LSD at the rear, while standard GT-R models come with the non-Pro system and a conventional mechanical differential. The V-Spec model also had firmer suspension and lower ground clearance, thanks to front and side splitters, as well as a rear carbon fibre air diffuser, <b>designed to keep air flowing smoothly under the car</b>.</p>
				<br>
				<p>At the time of the R34's introduction, like the R32 and R33, Nissan introduced an R34 V-Spec N1 model. The R34 V-Spec N1 was equipped similar to the R32 and R33 N1 models – a homologation special. It was sold without air conditioning, audio equipment, rear wiper, or boot lining, but ABS remained. The new R34 N1 was also given the new R34 N1 engine. Only 38 known R34 V-Spec N1 models were produced from the factory, 12 of which Nismo used for Super Taikyu racing. The rest were sold to various customers, mostly racing teams and tuning garages</p>
		
				<br><p>The V-Spec version was also imported into the UK with a number of modifications carried out on these 80 cars.These included 3 additional oil coolers, revised ECU map, full Connolly leather interior, underbody diffusers, stiffer suspension, active rear limited slip differential, extra display feature on the in car display. In additional to the UK, 10 were sold to Hong Kong and Singapore, and 5 to New Zealand although with different changes for their respective markets.
				<b>In October 2000</b>, Nissan introduced the V-Spec II, replacing the V-Spec. The V-Spec II has increased stiffness in the suspension (<i>even stiffer than the original V-Spec</i>) and had larger rear brake rotors. It also comes equipped with a carbon fibre bonnet equipped with a NACA duct, which is lighter than the aluminium that all other <b>GT-R</b> bonnets are made from. Also different on the V-Spec II was an iridium center console and aluminium pedals. The seats were upholstered with black cloth rather than the gray cloth used on previous R34 GT-R models, and the amber turn lenses were replaced with white versions. With the exception of the carbon fibre bonnet, the standard trim level GT-R also received these updates. A total of 18 V-Spec II N1 were built. A total of 1855 V-Spec II were built for Japan, with an additional 2 being sold for the New Zealand market. The V-Spec N1 was replaced with the V-Spec II N1. The same changes applied to the V-Spec N1 were applied to the V-Spec II N1, with the exception of the V-Spec II carbon bonnet which was now unpainted.</p>
				
				<br><p><b>In May 2001</b>, the M-Spec was introduced. It was based on the V-Spec II, but had special "Ripple control" dampers, revised suspension set up, stiffer rear sway bar and a leather interior with heated front seats. The 'M' on the M-Spec stood for <b>Mizuno</b> who is the chief engineer of Nissan. The only other change was the removal of the carbon fibre bonnet which was replaced with the standard aluminium bonnet. <b>In February 2002</b>, Nissan launched a final production model of the <b>R34 GT-R called the Skyline GT-R V-Spec II Nür and the Skyline GT-R M-Spec Nür</b> . The <b> Nür was named after the famous German Nürburgring racetrack</b> , where the Skyline was developed. In total 1,003 units R34 GT-R Nür(s) were produced, 718 were V-Spec II Nürs and 285 were M-Spec Nürs. The Nür model featured an improved RB26DETT based on the N1 racing engine. The standard turbochargers were upgraded to larger versions with a slight increase in boost and the ceramic blades were replaced with steel versions. This has increased lag, but the turbo's durability was improved while being able to handle a bigger boost increase. The V-Spec II Nür is based on the regular V-Spec II model, and the M-Spec Nür was based on the regular M-Spec model. Other than the addition of the Nür engine, the Nür models also included a different colour of stitching on the interior trim, as well as a speedometer reading up to 300 km/h , gold valve covers instead of red and a gold VIN plate instead of silver. Due to Japanese car industry norms at the time, the car was advertised as having 206 kW (<i> 280 PS; 276 hp</i> ) but it actually had over 246 kW (<i> 334 PS; 330 hp</i> ) when it left the factory.</p>
